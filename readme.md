# Trade:able Assignment

## Overview

This project provides a set of RESTful APIs for managing users, posts, and comments. It allows users to create, view, and edit their profiles, create posts, retrieve posts, and comment on posts.

### Purposefully, I have kept the .env file so that the setup becomes easy. Obviously,it will be gitignored in a real scenario

## Base URL

The base URL for all endpoints is: `http://localhost:3000/`

## To Run

### 1.npm install 2.npm start

## To Test (All comments written on the test file for each route)

### (ðŸ“Œ Before testing , replace the 'authToken' fields in the 'everything.test.js' file with the actual token received during login from the /api/login route)

### Now run npm test

#### (ðŸ“Œ The test of the /api/referral/expire route will not pass (return 400 bad request) if the referral link has not been used by 5 people or it hasnt been 5 days yet(I have set this))

## Authentication

### Authentication is required for certain endpoints.

### ( So in postman from the Authorization tab choose "Bearer Token" and paste the token which you received from login route)

### Rate Limiting(Bonus): If any of the refrral links are hit 10 times in a row,it will display the message:

#### "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later."
